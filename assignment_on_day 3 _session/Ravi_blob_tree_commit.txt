1. What are blob, tree, and commit object?
	blob: 
		A blob stores the content of a file, just the raw data, without any file name or folder structure. Every unique file content gets a unique blob ID.
		It’s how Git keeps track of file versions.
	tree:
		A tree object represents a directory. It links file names to blob IDs and can also include other trees (subdirectories). 
		It organizes blobs into a folder structure for each commit.
	Commit: 
		A commit object is a snapshot of your project. It points to a tree and includes metadata like author, date, and message. It also links to the previous commit,
		 forming a history of changes.
