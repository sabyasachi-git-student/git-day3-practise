1.What happens inside Git when you run git add file.txt?
Ans:Git takes the current version of file.txt and adds it to the staging area so it’s ready for the next commit.


2.Why do we say a commit is a snapshot, not a diff?
Ans:Because Git saves the entire state of all tracked files at that moment, not just the changes.


3.What is stored inside the .git folder?
Ans:It contains all Git metadata: commits, branches, tags, configuration, and object database.


4.What does HEAD point to, and how is it updated?
Ans:HEAD points to the current branch’s latest commit and updates when you commit or switch branches.


5.What’s the difference between the Working Directory and the Staging Area?
Ans:The working directory has your actual files; the staging area holds the versions you plan to commit.


6.What happens if you change a file after staging it?
Ans:The new changes stay in the working directory and won’t be committed unless you stage them again.


7.Why doesn’t Git store whole files for every commit?
Ans:To save space, Git stores files as objects and reuses unchanged data using hashes.


8.What is version control, and how does Git make it easier?
Ans:Version control tracks changes over time; Git makes it easy by allowing branching, merging, and history tracking.


9.What are tracked vs untracked files?
Ans:Tracked files are under Git’s control; untracked files are new and not yet added to Git.


10.Write the complete flow of commands from creating a repo to committing your first file:
Ans:
mkdir myrepo
cd myrepo
git init
echo "Hello" > file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"
